I recently spent 2 months agonizing over choosing the right PhD program, and 2 more months worrying that I had made a terrible decision, when in fact, I was in the extremely fortunate and privileged position of having multiple PhD offers. I thought this was a prime example of the [paradox of choice](https://youtu.be/VO6XEQIsCoM). I wanted to share my experience in case it resonates with others, and the lessons I've learned to help others and to remind my future self.

# Choosing a PhD Program and Analysis Paralysis

I applied to 5 PhD programs with a very clear idea of which program I wanted to go to (let's call it School A). When I received an offer from School A, which was also my first PhD admissions notification, I was ecstatic and felt like I couldn't be any happier! Then, I received three more offers, I was elated to receive so many great offers even though back then, I had my mind set on School A.

The prospective advisors from schools B, C, and D followed up to congratulate me and offer to answer any questions I had. To leave no stones unturned, and also to not waste such a lucky opportunity (I did not even expect to get these offers as these 3 schools are extremely competitive), I happily met with my prospective advisors. From there, I became really excited about the other three programs as well, and started to seriously consider each of them.

I felt like the more I learned about each school, the more it became difficult to choose just one. I made Zoom calls with 52 students and professors for advice. I spent 10 days physically visiting schools. I wrote 65 pages worth of notes after these meetings and visits. I made a spreadsheet with 19 weights and parameters to score 4 schools. Needless to say that I spent an exorbitant amount of time scrutinizing each choice.

Three days before the deadline to commit, I finally narrowed my choices down from 4 to 3 schools. The day before, I narrowed it down to 2. The night before, I made myself choose between schools A and B based on how I felt in that moment, and told myself to commit to that school if my mind hasn't changed after I slept on it. I woke up the morning of the deadline feeling really excited about my choice, school B, and in the late afternoon I finally submitted my decision.

# Spiralling Thoughts and Buyer's Remorse

After I committed, I felt extremely excited about the new future I just chose and relieved that I had finally made a decision. I also felt incredibly sad when announcing my decision to the other potential advisors I have spoken with, but grateful that they were all very supportive of my choice as well.

Then, the next day, 

# Satisficer vs. Maximizer

Looking back, I have been extremely satisfied with both my college and master's experiences, I cannot imagine how my time at both schools could have gotten any better. I also realized that I made these two choices very quickly. For college, I only applied to one school and went there, I spun a pencil to choose my double major. For my master's, I had 6 choices but quickly dismissed 4, and chose one after talking to 3 people.





# My Advice

From all the time I spent on my own decisions, I also now hold a lot of information and comparison notes about the 4 schools I was considering. If you end up struggling to choose between similar schools as I did (Berkeley, CMU, Stanford, UW), I am more than happy to schedule a chat and share my impressions of the differences between your options, depending on what you're looking for!
